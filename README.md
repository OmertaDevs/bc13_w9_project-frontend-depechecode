# School of Code Hub

The product is an application aiming to simplify the lives of school of code bootcampers.

The core concepts behind the application are:

. An easy to use search feature which will return a glossary definition and useful tech links to the user.

. Easy access to the tools that a student uses on a daily basis such as Zoom, Notion, Slack and Github.


The over all aim is to streamline the user experience so that instead of having several applications covering these areas this application will pool together all resources and tools so that they can be easily accessed from one location.
